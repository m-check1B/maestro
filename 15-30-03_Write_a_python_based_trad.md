Objective: Write a python based trading aplication using xtrade brokers api, including web ui.

======================================== Task Breakdown ========================================

Task 1:
Prompt: Sub-task: Research and choose a Python web framework for the trading application's user interface.

Prompt for subagent:

As a subagent, your task is to research suitable Python web frameworks for building the user interface of the trading application using the XTrade brokers API. Based on your research, select three appropriate frameworks and provide a brief explanation of why they are suitable for this project.

In your evaluation, consider factors like community support, documentation, ease of integration with APIs, and flexibility in building the desired features for the trading application.

Once you have selected the frameworks, please create a list with the following format:

1. Framework Name: (describe the framework's essential features, why it is a good fit for the project)
2. Framework Name: (describe the framework's essential features, why it is a good fit for the project)
3. Framework Name: (describe the framework's essential features, why it is a good fit for the project)

Upon completion, the subagent should return this list in the requested format, allowing the AI orchestrator to choose the most appropriate framework for the project and delegate the next sub-task.
Result: 1. Django: 
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It's built by experienced developers and takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It has a large community, good documentation, and extensive third-party packages. Django's flexibility and scalability make it suitable for the trading application. Additionally, its strong community support ensure that there will be assistance available when integrating with the XTrade brokers API.

2. Flask: 
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python, designed as a microframework. It is easy to get started with and remains unobtrusive, meaning it does not enforce dependencies or project layout, so it can be adapted to fit your needs. Flask includes a development server and a fast debugger, both of which allow for quick and easy development. Its built-in development server and debugger make it a great choice for a trading application, where fast prototyping and iteration are important. Furthermore, Flask's active community can provide support when integrating with APIs and extending the application with new features.

3. Pyramid: 
Pyramid is a small, fast, down-to-earth, open source Python web framework. It is developed as part of the Pylons Project. It is designed to make creating web applications easier. One of its key features is its flexibility and minimalistic approach, which allows developers to use exactly what they need for their project. Pyramid is a good fit for the trading application as it offers a solid foundation for building web applications of all sizes. The framework has a good community, and the documentation is extensive and thorough. Pyramid's flexibility and ease of integration with APIs make it a suitable choice for the project.

Task 2:
Prompt: The task is not complete:

Sub-task: Choose a Python web framework for the trading application.

Prompt for subagent:

Based on the provided information, you need to choose a Python web framework for the trading application. Carefully evaluate the features and benefits of Django, Flask, and Pyramid, and select the one that best fits the requirements of the trading application.

In making your decision, consider the following factors:

1. Flexibility and scalability: The framework should be able to handle the trading application's needs now and in the future.
2. Community support: A strong community can provide assistance when integrating with the XTrade brokers API and extending the application with new features.
3. Ease of integration: The framework should have a good track record for integrating with third-party APIs.
4. Documentation: Thorough documentation can help streamline the development process and reduce the learning curve.
5. Project requirements: Consider the specific needs of the trading application, such as rapid development, fast prototyping, and iteration.

Once you have chosen a web framework, create a convincing argument for your decision by summarizing the key features of the chosen framework and how it addresses the needs of the trading application. Provide examples, if necessary.

It is important to note that the code provided in previous sub-tasks should be error-free and meet the requirements for the trading application. If there are any bugs or suggestions for improvement, address them in the next sub-task prompt.
Result: After careful consideration of the features, benefits, and project requirements for Django, Flask, and Pyramid, I have chosen Django as the most suitable Python web framework for the trading application. Here's why:

1. Flexibility and scalability: Django is designed to handle projects of varying sizes and complexity. It can easily evolve with the trading application as it grows and adapts to new requirements.

2. Community support: Django has a large, active community that can provide assistance when integrating with the XTrade brokers API and extending the application with new features. Moreover, its community-driven packages can help speed up development processes and ensure compatibility.

3. Ease of integration: Django has a good track record for integrating with third-party APIs, thanks to its robust and extensible ORM and rich ecosystem of reusable components.

4. Documentation: Django's documentation is thorough, clear, and accessible. Comprehensive documentation helps streamline the development process and reduces the learning curve, allowing developers to create and maintain the trading application more efficiently.

5. Project requirements: Django promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Its flexibility, scalability, and intuitive design make it an excellent fit for the trading application's specific needs, including fast prototyping, iteration, and robust trading features.

In conclusion, Django's flexibility, community support, ease of integration, documentation, and strong alignment with project requirements make it the ideal Python web framework for the trading application. This choice ensures that the development process will be efficient, maintainable, and adaptable, meeting both the current and future needs of the trading application.

Task 3:
Prompt: Sub-task: Implement a Django-based trading application with XTrade brokers API integration.
